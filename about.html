            <h1>From travelling to finding my home</h1>
            <p>I was stuck my whole life in Spain, so once I moved to Paris I begun travelling. The first country I ever explored was Denmark, followed quickly by Japan.</p>
            <p>Most people have a place they call home and most people know where they belong but as a child who's life was quite chaotic, having to constantly adapt to different cultures and being way too young to be impressed by my own country, it was hard for me to have a place I could call home.</p>
            <p>I don't know whether it's because it was the impact of travelling that made these two countries feel so special to me, or it was just because they are special... But in Denmark, I instantly felt at ease, almost like time slowed down here and I could take a breath and enjoy what's around me.</p>
            <p>While having a coffee down by the lakes, looking out the window and being in awe with the people jogging in the dusty rain I swore myself that someday I'll live in Denmark for the rest of my life.</p>

            <h1>From being a maid to being a boss</h1>
            <p>As a young girl in desperate need of a job to be able to start her life in Denmark I did what all immigrants do: clean.</p>
            <p>My first 4 jobs in Denmark were all cleaning jobs but they were so poorly paid that I had to get a second, then a third job. All at the same time. The ammount of hours I slept per night were less than 4 and my body was slowly giving up.</p>
            <p>I never complained and I was just happy that I had a job but I felt that all my creativity was going to waste and so I decided to start my own business.</p>
            <p>So in 2018 I opened my own photography business and slowly gave up on all the jobs I had to the point where after being accepted into KEA, I was living off the earnings from my business.</p>

            <h1>From being a boss to being a student</h1>
            <p>Accepted into KEA was more to me than just being accepted into university. I was given a chance to learn new skills that help my creativity flow and grow.</p>
            <p>It's quite hard to kee a business rolling and being a student, and since my focus has switched a bit I started looking for a student job.</p>
            <p>after 4 months of waiting patiently to get a job in an office, I finally got employed at hobbii.dk as a SoMe manager.</p>
            <p>I have no idea what the future will bring but  but I keep working in my own business and hopefully someday I can make a comfortable living doing what I like the most: being creative!</p>
