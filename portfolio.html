        <h1>BASIC WEB</h1>
        <p>Basic, you say? Despite calling it "basic", it was an intensive introduction to the primary tools of Multimedia Design. Human brains are hardwired to connect the dots and make sense out of everything the eyes see. In Basic Web I learned about different layout principles so we can dominate better the usage of positive space (represented by the elements we use) and negative space (the background). I was also  introduced to a beautiful language: coding! </p>

                <h3>Basic mobile website</h3>
                <p>How we arrange the elements in the negative space we are given is crucial in order to create something that the brain can recognize easily.</p>
                <p>The <strong>Gestalt Laws</strong> can be compared to the Ten Commendaments of the Design Bible. During this project I used the <strong>law of symmetry</strong> in the three column layout (for desktop) and single column layout (for mobile). I have also used the <strong>law of proximity</strong> in the navigation menu.

                <p>We were given a style to work with during our first theme. Mine was Deconstructivism, a movement of postmodern architecture which appeared in the 1980s. After gathering information I proceeded to curating wireframes and moodboards for this given style. The result is a XD prototype for an imaginary (mobile) website that promotes the history and artists during this genre's period.

                <p> During Basic Mobile Website I discovered that html is like a canvas and css is our brush and paint. During Responsive Website I learned that not only I can style the content of my html but also make it suitable for every device and every screen size, no matter how large or small! Hello CSS Grids and media queries!

                <p>We had to animate an image using CSS and... (Hello there) Javascript! This exercise was mainly so we can explore and have fun with some javascript functions. Javascript was a real challenge for me, because at that time I could barely understand how grids work. I was really proud of how these animations turned out because of the effort I put in and the result is exactly what I wanted.</p>

At the time we didn't quite grasp the idea of what an interactive production was. Only later we realized that our abilities were limited in comparation to how our ideas.</p>

                <p>I was in charge of writing, filming and editing the video in Premiere Pro. It was quite challenging to represent all the elements without dialogue.</p>

                <p>In our storyboard the main character (Lisa) breaks the 4th wall and speaks directly to the viewer. Apart from this obvious dramaturgical element, gestures can be detected during the point-of-no-return, when our main character meets a man that seems interested in her. The romantic story in our video makes the mood of the movie very light and funny. We took this approach because we wanted to keep the viewer entertained while learning this basic rules of cycling.</p>
